# Transact

**Transact** is a simple web application that demonstrates the basic logic of creating and managing accounts in different currencies (`EUR`, `USD`, `JPY`), user authentication, viewing accounts, performing transactions between accounts, and automatic currency conversion during transactions.

The project is developed using:
- **Frontend:** [Next.js 15.2.1](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Backend:** [AdonisJS 6.17.2](https://adonisjs.com/)

üöÄ **This project is still in development.** More details about the libraries used can be found in the `README.md` files inside the `frontend` and `backend` directories.

## ‚ú® Features

The application currently includes the following features:
- **Localization** (English, German, French)
- **Themes** (System, Light, Dark)
- **Live Exchange Rates** (Test data generated on the backend)
- **User Authentication**
  - Registration
  - Login
- **Dashboard** (User account overview)
  - **Accounts**
    - View a list of all user accounts.
    - Create a new account in a selected currency. *(For testing purposes, when an account is created, an automatic transfer of 100 units in the selected currency is made from a system-generated "Bank" user. This transaction will be visible on the Transactions page or in the account details.)*
    - View details of a specific account by its ID.
  - **Transactions**
    - View all incoming and outgoing transactions related to user accounts.
    - **Create Transactions** (Transfer money to another account, either the user‚Äôs own or another user‚Äôs account. If the selected accounts have different currencies, automatic conversion will be performed.)

üìå **New features and improvements are planned in future updates.**
